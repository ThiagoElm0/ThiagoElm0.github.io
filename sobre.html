        <h4 class="sub_t">Casal Warren</h4>

                <p>Edward "Ed" Warren Miney (7 de setembro de 1926 — 23 de agosto de 2006) e Lorraine Rita Warren (31 de janeiro de 1927 — 18 de abril de 2019) foram investigadores de fenômenos paranormais e autores associados com casos de destaque de assombração. Edward foi um veterano da Marinha na Segunda Guerra Mundial e ex-oficial de polícia que tornou-se um autodidata, especialista em demonologia, autor e conferencista. Sua esposa Lorraine era uma clarividente e médium de transe leve que trabalhou com o marido.</p>
                <p>Em 1952, os Warren fundaram a New England Society for Psychic Research (N.E.S.P.R.), o mais antigo grupo de caça-fantasmas na Nova Inglaterra. Eles escreveram vários livros sobre o paranormal e sobre suas investigações privadas em vários relatos de atividade paranormal. Eles alegaram ter investigado mais de 10.000 casos durante sua carreira. Os Warren estavam entre os primeiros investigadores no polêmico The Amityville Horror. De acordo com o Warren, o N.E.S.P.R. utiliza uma variedade de indivíduos, incluindo médicos, pesquisadores, policiais, enfermeiros, estudantes universitários e membros do clero em suas investigações.</p>
                <p>Os Warren foram responsáveis pelo treinamento de vários demonólogos, incluindo Dave Considine e seu sobrinho John Zaffis. Além das investigações, Lorraine dirigiu o Museu Oculto dos Warren no porão de sua casa em Monroe, Connecticut, com a ajuda de seu genro, Tony Spera.</p>

                <h6 class="sub_t">Annabelle</h6>
                <p>The real case of Annabelle involves a possessed doll that gained international attention for its alleged paranormal activities. The story began when a nursing student named Donna received the doll as a gift from her mother in the early 1970s. Donna and her roommate Angie started noticing strange occurrences in their apartment shortly after bringing Annabelle into their home.</p>
                <p>The doll seemed to have a life of its own, moving around the apartment, changing positions, and even leaving handwritten notes. It also appeared to be possessed, as it would often change facial expressions and emit eerie sounds. The girls soon realized that there was something deeply unsettling about the doll and sought help.</p>
                <p>They contacted paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren, who determined that Annabelle was not an ordinary doll but instead a conduit for a malevolent entity. According to the Warrens, the doll was inhabited by the spirit of a deceased girl named Annabelle Higgins. They believed that the doll was manipulating its surroundings and causing harm to those who came into contact with it.</p>
                <p>The Warrens eventually took possession of the doll, deeming it too dangerous to be kept with the public. They placed Annabelle in a secure case in their Occult Museum, where it remains to this day. The case and the doll have become popular subjects in the realm of paranormal investigations, inspiring movies such as "The Conjuring" series and its spin-off film "Annabelle".</p>
                <p>While skeptics question the authenticity of the case, the story of Annabelle continues to fascinate and terrify people around the world.</p>

                        <p>The haunting experienced by the Perron family in Harrisville, Rhode Island, was also associated with the presence of a malevolent witch.

They worked with the Perron family to understand and mitigate the effects of the witch's presence, providing guidance and support during their investigation.</p>

                    <h6 class="sub_t">Trial of Arne Cheyenne Johnson</h6>
                    <p>The trial of Arne Cheyenne Johnson took place in 1981 in the United States. Arne Cheyenne Johnson was accused of murdering his landlord, Alan Bono, during an altercation. The case became known as "The Devil Made Me Do It" case due to the defense's claim that Johnson was possessed by a demon at the time of the crime.</p>
                    <p>Johnson's defense argued that he was under the influence of supernatural forces and that demonic possession was the cause of the murder. They cited the prior involvement of the couple Ed and Lorraine Warren, renowned paranormal investigators, in cases related to Johnson's family as evidence.</p>
                    <p>However, the judge ruled that the claim of demonic possession was not a legally valid defense for the charge of murder. The trial proceeded based on conventional evidence, and Johnson was found guilty of manslaughter and received a reduced sentence.</p>
                    <p>The trial of Arne Cheyenne Johnson is notable because it marked the first time in U.S. legal history that a defense of demonic possession was presented in court. It garnered significant media attention and inspired movies and books on the subject.</p>
